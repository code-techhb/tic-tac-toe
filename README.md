# Tic Tac Toe Game üïπÔ∏è

This is a console-based implementation of the classic two-player Tic Tac Toe game. This game allows two players to take 
turns in 
placing their marks (`X` and `T`) on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. If neither player achieves this after 9 moves, the game ends in a draw.

## **How to Play ‚ñ∂Ô∏è**

1. **Game Setup**:
   - The game is initialized with an empty 3x3 grid, numbered from 1 to 9, representing the positions where players can place their marks.
   
2. **Making a Move**:
   - On each turn, players are prompted to choose a number (1-9) corresponding to an empty cell on the grid.
   - Player 1 uses the mark `X` and Player 2 uses the mark `T`.

3. **Winning**:
   - The game checks for a win after every move. A player wins if they place their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.
   
4. **Draw**:
   - If all cells are filled and no player wins, the game results in a draw.

5. **Rematch**:
   - After the game ends, players are prompted if they want to play again. Type `Y` for yes, or any other key to exit.
